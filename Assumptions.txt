The elevator will finish all UP requests before starting DOWN requests. 
Assume that the elevator going up has more priority than going down, which means that when the elevator is in IDLE state, 
and has both up and down requests, it will execute up requests first.
I used a max heap to store all down requests and sort them by their desired floor. 
Similarly, a min heap to store all up requests and sort them by their desired floor.
When, the requester is outside of the elevator, the elevator needs to stop at the currentFloor of the requester, before going to the desiredFloor of the requester.
